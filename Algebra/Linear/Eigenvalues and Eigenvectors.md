# Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
An **eigenvector**, $\mathbf{x}$, of a linear transformation is a nonzero vector that changes at most by a scalar factor when that linear transformation is applied to it. The corresponding **eigenvalue**, $\lambda$, is the factor by which the eigenvector is scaled.[^wiki] That is,

$$\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}=\lambda\mathbf{x}$$

Let $\mathbf{e}$ denote normalized eigenvectors.
