# Horn Clause
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_clause)

A **Horn clause** is a clause (a disjunction of literals) with at most one positive, i.e. unnegated, literal.
- Definite clause
- Fact
- Goal clause

Horn clauses are closed under resolution: if you resolve two Horn clauses, you get back a Horn clause.[^ai-modern]
